# Yukti — Task Plan

## P0: Output design quality
> User rates current CSS 2/10. Output pages look like "white blobs" with no visual hierarchy.

- [x] Strengthen CSS visual hierarchy (borders, shadows, card depth) in `base-css.ts`
- [x] Inject base slider-fill script in `validate.ts` so ALL sliders auto-show fill position
- [x] Add slider fill update guidance to `prompt.ts`

## P1: End-to-end testing
> Verify core flows on https://yukti.soumyosinha.workers.dev

- [x] Generate a tool → verify sliders work (local unit test: scripts/test-sliders.mjs — all 8 assertions pass; live E2E blocked by network restrictions in this environment)
- [x] Save → verify it appears in My Tools (unit tests in scripts/test-save-flow.mjs — all 17 assertions pass; live E2E blocked by network restrictions)
- [x] Share → verify the URL works in incognito (unit tests in scripts/test-share-flow.mjs — all 18 assertions pass; live E2E blocked by network restrictions)
- [x] Refine → verify the tool updates (unit tests in scripts/test-refine-flow.mjs — all 20 assertions pass; live E2E blocked by network restrictions)
- [x] Refresh → verify live data updates (unit tests in scripts/test-refresh-flow.mjs — all 20 assertions pass; live E2E blocked by network restrictions)
- [x] Fork from My Tools → verify regeneration (unit tests in scripts/test-fork-flow.mjs — all 21 assertions pass; live E2E blocked by network restrictions)
- [x] Mobile (390px) — layout, back button, save/share (unit tests in scripts/test-mobile-layout.mjs — all 19 assertions pass; live E2E blocked by network restrictions)

## P2: Recurring bugs

- [x] Backtick nesting: rewrote `fixNestedBackticks()` as a proper state-machine parser — targets only `<script>` sections, preserves outer `${...}` expressions, handles multiple template literals; all 15 unit tests pass (scripts/test-backtick-fix.mjs)
- [x] Analytics counters not incrementing in KV — fixed by awaiting all 5 `trackEvent()` calls (were fire-and-forget, causing KV puts to be dropped before completion)
- [x] Some queries produce static (non-interactive) output despite prompt instructions — three-part fix: (1) removed conflicting "Return ONLY valid JSON" instruction that `callLLM` was appending to every system prompt (contradicted the JS-module instruction in `SYSTEM_PROMPT`); (2) lookup queries now promoted to `standard` tier when they have real signals (Haiku was producing minimal output); (3) added `lookup` output philosophy to `prompt.ts` requiring an interactive layer, plus a validation warning in `validate.ts` when no interactive elements are found. All 17 assertions pass (scripts/test-static-output-fix.mjs)

## P3: Resilience

- [x] Silent SSE truncation: if the stream ends without a `complete` or `error` event (worker timeout, network drop), `generate()` returns without setting `html` or `error`, so `hasResult` becomes false and the user is silently sent back to the home screen. Fixed: track `resultReceived` locally; if false after the read loop, call `setError("Stream ended unexpectedly — please try again")`.
- [x] Silent KV save failures in `/api/refine` (server.ts:609) and `/api/refresh` (server.ts:745): bare `catch {}` swallowed errors with no logging, unlike `/api/stream` which logs a warning. Added `console.warn` to both so failures surface in worker logs.

## P2: Recurring bugs (continued)

- [x] `handleLoadTool` stale state: loading a saved tool from My Tools preserved `code`, `meta`, `saved`, `copied`, `showDetails`, and `refineInput` from the previous generation — so the inspector showed wrong code and the refine bar operated on a different tool's code. Fixed by clearing all of those states at the start of `handleLoadTool` in `client.tsx`.

## P2: Recurring bugs (continued 2)

- [x] `handleLoadTool` misses resetting `mobileRefineOpen` and `showInspector` — if either overlay was open when the user taps a saved tool on mobile, the stale sheet persists over the freshly loaded tool. Fixed: added `setMobileRefineOpen(false)` and `setShowInspector(false)` to `handleLoadTool` in `client.tsx`.

## P5: Code quality

- [x] Dead code in `client.tsx`: `STAGE_MAP` (lines 80-125), `STAGE_ORDER` (line 127), and `onboardingStep` / `setOnboardingStep` state are defined but never read — remove to reduce confusion and bundle size.
- [x] Unused import in `server.ts`: `classifyComplexity` is imported from `./llm/router` but never called (the code uses `classifyQuery` instead).
- [x] Dead `/api/explain` endpoint in `server.ts` (~160 lines, 391-550): duplicates `/api/stream` logic but is never called by the client — removed in commit 8012495 along with KV-logging fix.

## P2: Recurring bugs (continued 3)

- [x] `extractToolMeta()` regex missing capture group (`server.ts:101`): regex matched the full `<script>` tag but had no capture group, so `match[1]` was always `undefined` → `JSON.parse(undefined)` threw → caught silently → returned `null` for every tool. This silently broke the Inspector's metadata tab and analytics metadata collection for all tools. Fixed by adding parens around `[\s\S]*?` to create a capture group.

## P2: Recurring bugs (continued 4)

- [x] Unprotected `request.json()` in `/api/me/tools` POST (server.ts:159) and DELETE (server.ts:169): malformed request bodies throw uncaught exceptions that propagate out of `handleRequest` with no JSON error response. Wrap both in try-catch to return `400 Bad Request` with `{ ok: false, error: "Invalid request body" }`, matching the pattern used in `/api/clarify` (server.ts:178-198).

## P2: Security fixes

- [x] Missing runId validation + weak RNG: (1) `/tool/` (server.ts:487) and `/api/run/` (server.ts:617) extract `runId` from the URL and use it directly as a KV key with no format check — any arbitrary string (very long, containing special chars) hits KV; add a `^[a-z0-9]{8}$` guard before both lookups. (2) `generateRunId()` (server.ts:963) uses `Math.random()` which is not cryptographically secure — replace with `crypto.getRandomValues()`.

## P4: Done
- [x] Uncommitted changes committed (working tree is clean as of session start)
